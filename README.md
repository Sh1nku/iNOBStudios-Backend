This is the API for the blog engine runnning at [iNOBStudios.com](https://inobstudios.com) It is written using `ASP.Net Core 3.0`, while the front end uses `Svelte`
I wanted to write a blog with the following features

 - Front-end driven layout processing (the back-end just delivers data)
 - Attachments
 - Tagging
 - Editor with preview
 - Code highlighting
 - Images with descriptions
 - References
 - Static aliases for posts
 - API driven customizable menus

 In addition the following items are not yet implemented
 - Post series (previous, next)
 - SEO
   * Force SSR for googlebot
   * Social media hints
   * sitemap.xml
 - Docker image
