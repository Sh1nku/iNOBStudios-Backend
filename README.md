This is the blog engine runnning at [iNOBStudios.com](https://inobstudios.com) It is written using `ASP.Net Core 3.0` and `Vue.js`
I wanted to write a blog with the following features

 - Front-end driven layout processing (the back-end just delivers data)
 - Attachments
 - Tagging
 - Editor with preview
 - Code highlighting
 - Images with descriptions
 - References

I made a [blog post](https://inobstudios.com/Post/4/A%20new%20front-page) describing the implementation and features
